# LIRI

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI has four main commands:

    * `my-tweets`

    * `spotify-this-song`

    * `movie-this`

    * `do-what-it-says`

## my-tweets

* This will show the last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

## spotify-this-song "song name"

* This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
     
     * Artist(s)
     
     * The song's name
     
     * A preview link of the song from Spotify
     
     * The album that the song is from

* If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

## movie-this "movie name"

* This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     
* If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
     
## do-what-it-says
     
     * LIRI will use the text in the random.txt file to run a random command

### I hope you enjoy seeing what LIRI can do!
